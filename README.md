# catch-the-light

This is an old Arduino project I made for a carnival my elementary school hosted. The program bounces a light back and forth along a line of lights, and the player has to hit a button when the light is at either end of the line.

This code has no comments because I wrote it way before I understood how important they would be. There is a second version of this program at https://github.com/sustainmain/catch-the-light-2
